Navigation Maze Route generator algorithm

Atrribute:
(In one trial)
1. Total length (steps): 14
2. Total rotate times : 6
3. number of Straight question : 3 

(In one experiment)
1. Total run : 21 
2. Number of without landmark : 7
3. Number of landmark1 : 7
4. Number of landmark4 : 7


Algorithm:
Summarize of Route generator 
1. First step must be straight 
2. Take "Total length" , "Total rotate" , "number of Straight question" as input 
3. Generate a list of rotate index by gaussian average
   ex : (2,4,6,8,10,12) which crossroad should take turn
   
   the interval of each turn is at average 1~2 
   when you get interval 1 (ex : 2, 3, 4) there's only a number between 2 and 4 
   So the next turn is 4

4. Decide turn left or turn right by random
5. Pick three straight steps to be the question (this will auto skip index 1 )
